# payable-token-1363

## What I would have done with more time

- BondingCurve:
    - create abstract class BondingCurve
    - LinearBondingCurve extends BondingCurve

- ERC1363
    - Mint not really optimal, anyone can mint at the moment - better solution would be to have ERC20 being owned by the contract.
